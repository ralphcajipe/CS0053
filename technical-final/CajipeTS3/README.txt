Book Database
By Ralph Cajipe

My MLBooks.db database has the following fields:

- title
- author
- year
- isbn

The Java application opens up to a blank JFrame with a background.

The File menu has the following options:
- Add Record
- View Records
- Delete Record
- Exit

I can add books to my database, view all books in a text area, delete a specific book, and exit the application.

The application needs to connect to the SQLite Database (MLBooks.db) using SQLite JDBC Driver as dependency.

To run the application, open the project called "CajipeTS3" in IntelliJ IDEA or
any equivalent Java IDE (like Netbeans) and run the file "MainTS3.java".
